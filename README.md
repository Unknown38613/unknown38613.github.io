I want to learn __ from scratch.
Assume I have **zero prior knowledge** about this topic and do not understand any related terminology.
Teach me in a **deep, structured, and beginner‑friendly way**, following these rules:
1. **Start from first principles**
   - Explain what the topic is
   - Why it exists
   - What problems it solves
   - Where it is used in the real world
2. **Define every term**
   - Do not assume I know any technical words
   - Introduce terminology gradually
   - Explain each term in simple language before using it further
3. **Build step‑by‑step**
   - Move from very basic ideas to advanced concepts
   - Clearly label sections as *Beginner*, *Intermediate*, and *Advanced*
   - Do not skip logical steps
4. **Use intuitive explanations**
   - Use analogies, metaphors, and real‑life examples
   - Prefer intuition first, then formal definitions
5. **Explain the “why” behind everything**
   - Why this concept is needed
   - Why it works this way
   - Why alternatives are not used
6. **Include practical examples**
   - Simple examples early
   - More realistic or technical examples later
   - If applicable, include small code snippets or pseudo‑code and explain them line by line
7. **Visualize mentally**
   - Describe diagrams or mental models in words
   - Explain how concepts connect to each other
8. **Highlight common misconceptions**
   - What beginners usually misunderstand
   - Typical mistakes and how to avoid them
9. **Check understanding**
   - Ask me small questions occasionally
   - Provide short exercises or thought experiments
10. **End with a learning roadmap**
    - What I should learn next
    - How this topic connects to other topics
    - Recommended practice ideas
      
Teach me as if you were mentoring me 1‑on‑1 and wanted me to truly **understand**, not just memorize.

### 3. High-Level Design (HLD)

**Basic HLD**

* [ ] Client-Server Model
* [ ] Network Protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP/HTTPS)
* [ ] DNS (Domain Name System)
* [ ] API Paradigms (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
* [ ] Communication Models (WebSockets, Long Polling, Server-Sent Events)

**Intermediate HLD**

* [ ] Scaling (Vertical/Scale-Up vs. Horizontal/Scale-Out)
* [ ] Load Balancing (Layer 4 vs. Layer 7)
* [ ] Proxies (Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy)
* [ ] Caching (CDNs, Redis/Memcached)
* [ ] Cache Eviction Policies (LRU, LFU)

* [ ] ACID Properties

**Advanced HLD**

* [ ] Architecture Styles (Monolith vs. Microservices)
* [ ] CAP Theorem & PACELC Theorem
* [ ] Database Scaling (Sharding, Partitioning)
* [ ] Database Replication (Master-Slave, Master-Master)
* [ ] Asynchronous Processing (Message Queues, Task Queues)
* [ ] Event Streaming (Apache Kafka) & Pub/Sub Models
* [ ] Consistent Hashing
* [ ] Rate Limiting
* [ ] Service Discovery & API Gateways
* [ ] Distributed Consensus Algorithms (Paxos, Raft)
* [ ] Leader Election
* [ ] Distributed Locks
* [ ] Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions)

In 2026, the landscape of system design has shifted significantly. While the fundamentals (scalability, load balancing, etc.) remain the bedrock, "Modern System Design" now assumes that systems are **AI-native**, **cost-aware (FinOps)**, and **secure by default**.

### 4. AI-Native & Agentic Design

*This is the biggest shift. We no longer just "add AI"; we design systems where AI is in the critical request path.*

* [ ] **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Architecting "context-aware" systems using vector search.
* [ ] **Vector Databases:** Understanding high-dimensional data storage (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus).
* [ ] **Agentic Workflows:** Designing for autonomous agents that can call tools and make decisions.
* [ ] **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** A new standard for how AI agents interact with your data and tools.
* [ ] **SLMs at the Edge:** Deploying "Small Language Models" on local devices to reduce latency and cost.
* [ ] **LLM Orchestration:** Patterns like the Orchestrator-Worker for complex AI task delegation.

---

### 5. Modern Infrastructure & Operations

*The focus has moved from "how to build" to "how to build efficiently and sustainably."*

* [ ] **Serverless-First & Stateful Serverless:** Using durable functions to handle state without managing servers.
* [ ] **FinOps (Cost-Driven Architecture):** Treating "Cloud Cost" as a primary technical constraint, not a budget issue.
* [ ] **Data Mesh:** Decentralized data ownership where teams treat data as a "product" with formal **Data Contracts**.
* [ ] **Platform Engineering:** Moving beyond DevOps to build Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs).
* [ ] **WebAssembly (Wasm):** Using Wasm for high-performance, cross-platform execution in the backend and at the edge.

---

### 6. Security, Resilience & Ethics

*In 2026, security isn't a layer; it's the foundation.*

* [ ] **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA):** The "never trust, always verify" model for service-to-service communication.
* [ ] **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Designing systems that are ready for the era of quantum computing.
* [ ] **AI Observability:** Monitoring for "model drift," hallucinations, and AI-specific security threats (like prompt injection).
* [ ] **Privacy-Preserving Computation:** Techniques like Federated Learning or Homomorphic Encryption.

---

### 7. Sustainability (Green Software Engineering)

*Energy efficiency is now a core requirement for large-scale systems.*

* [ ] **Carbon-Aware Design:** Scheduling heavy batch jobs to run when the power grid is using renewable energy.
* [ ] **Energy-Efficient Algorithms:** Optimizing code specifically to reduce the CPU/GPU thermal footprint.
* [ ] **Circular Design:** Planning for hardware lifecycle and resource reuse in data center choices.

**Pro-Tip for 2026:** If you are interviewing or building today, the most impressive skill isn't knowing how to scale a database—it's knowing how to integrate an **AI Agent** into a system without it costing a fortune or leaking private data.
